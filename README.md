# Medical images recognition - Medical MNIST analysis

The project focuses on Medical MNIST analysis. Models for image classification are developed, the results are looked into as well as some models performance visualisations are presented.

There are following notebooks in the repository:
* [Primary notebook](notebooks/Medical-MNIST.ipynb) - dataset analysis and preparation along with model training 
* [Results](notebooks/Medical-MNIST-results.ipynb) - lerning curves, ROC and PR curves, images from outside the dataset
* [Occlusion sensitivity](notebooks/Occlusion-sensitivity.ipynb) - occlusion sensitivity for different models
